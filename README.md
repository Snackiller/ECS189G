Project of deep learning

Stage 2: Data classification with MLP model based on PyTorch
  Train the MLP model with the training data, and apply the learned model to the testing set. Generate the learning curve plots, and report the final evaluation result.
  Change the model architecture with more layers, with different loss functions, different optimizers and other settings to increase the performance score.
  
Stage 3: Image classification for object recognition with CNN model
  Train a CNN model with the hand-written digit images, and apply it to recognize the digit images in the testing set. Generate the learning curves and report the evaluation results.
  Train two other CNN models with the face images and colored objects, and apply them to recognize the faces and color objects in the testing set, respectively. Generate the learning curves and report the results.
  Change the configurations of the provided CNN model (with different model depth, kernel size, padding, stride, pooling layer, hidden layer dimension, different loss function, etc.), and report the results to see the impacts of configuration on the model performance.
  
Stage 4: Text classification and generation with RNN model
  Train a RNN model with the text classification dataset, and apply it to classify the testing set. Generate the learning curves and report the evaluation results.
  Train a RNN model with the text generation dataset, and use the trained model to generate a story starting with three starting words. Compare the generation result with the training data to evaluate its correctness, and report the results.
  Change the RNN with LSTM and GRU units, respectively.
  
Stage 5: Graph Embedding and Node Classification with GNN model
  Train a GCN model with the Cora dataset, and apply it to classify the testing set. Generate the learning curves and report the evaluation results.
  Re-do on Pubmed and Citeseer datasets as well, and report the results.
